    Represents a C++ bit of code that returns a value. Like a function call or a member call.
    Use the be-fore the wire visit phase of processing to look for a pattern that needs
    to generate AST code, like a method call. Then place this AST in place of the function.
    The back-end will then do the rendering useing the information included below.
